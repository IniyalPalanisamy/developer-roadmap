## What is Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning?  
Hierarchical reinforcement learning(HRL) is a relatively new discipline in the deep learning space that models a learning problems as a hierarchy of related sub-problems. Consider the problem of an agent trying to learn how to navigate a maze to obtain a simple reward.
Definition. The learning hierarchy technique is a top-down analysis technique that can be used by an instructional designer (or a teacher) to identify the prerequisites for an expected learning outcome (learning objective) in the intellectual learning domain.
