# AlphaZero
## What is alphazero?
 AlphaZero is a computer program developed by artificial intelligence research company DeepMind to master the games of chess, shogi and go. This algorithm uses an approach similar to AlphaGo Zero.

On December 5, 2017, the DeepMind team released a preprint introducing AlphaZero, which within 24 hours of training achieved a superhuman level of play in these three games by defeating world-champion programs Stockfish, elmo, and the three-day version of AlphaGo Zero. 
BigGAN is a type of generative adversarial network that was designed for scaling generation to high-resolution, high-fidelity images. It includes a number of incremental changes and innovations. The baseline and incremental changes are: Using SAGAN as a baseline with spectral normal.
