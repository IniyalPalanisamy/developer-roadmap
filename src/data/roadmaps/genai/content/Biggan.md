# BigGan
## What does BigGAN do?
BigGAN is a type of generative adversarial network that was designed for scaling generation to high-resolution, high-fidelity images. It includes a number of incremental changes and innovations. The baseline and incremental changes are: Using SAGAN as a baseline with spectral norm.
