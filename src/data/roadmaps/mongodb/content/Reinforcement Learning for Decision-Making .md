# Reinforcement Learning for Decision-Making 
## Definition
Reinforcement learning is an adaptive process in which an animal utilizes its previous experience to improve the outcomes of future choices. Computational theories of reinforcement learning play a central role in the newly emerging areas of neuroeconomics and decision neuroscience.
What are the three main types of reinforcement learning?
Three approaches to Reinforcement Learning

Now that we defined the main elements of Reinforcement Learning, let's move on to the three approaches to solve a Reinforcement Learning problem. These are value-based, policy-based, and model-based.
